            <p>NBlog - A NodeJS project on the Node registry that was built as a quick and simple blogging platform.</p>
            <p>One of my most enjoyable projects was a NodeJS module called NBlog. I initially created this to learn about NodeJS and implemented it as my blog at the time. It uses MongoDB and Express and it's available on the NPM registry and via Github.</p>
